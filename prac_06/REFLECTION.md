# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I paid more attention to the structure and readability of my code, for example by following Python specifications and 
using clearer loops and conditional statements to optimise the logic of my code. I also started estimating the time of 
programming tasks in advance and keeping track of estimated and actual completion times in my code to improve my time 
management skills.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to manage my study time better, avoid procrastination, and plan more clearly for each exercise or assignment. 
In addition, I would like to improve the efficiency of debugging and testing, reduce the number of repeated revisions 
due to minor errors, and improve overall programming efficiency.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I've developed good code commenting and testing habits, and I run unit tests after each code write to ensure correct 
functionality.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I'm going to think more deeply about optimisation options to improve the quality of my code.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like the course to include more content on code optimisation and practical project management, such as how to 
write more efficient code and how to collaborate on code in a team. In addition, more real-life examples can be added to
give students a better understanding of how to apply programming skills in real work.
