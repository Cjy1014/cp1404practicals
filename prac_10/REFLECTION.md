# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was not very accurate at the beginning. I often underestimated the time required, especially for 
unfamiliar concepts or larger problems.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I progressed, I got better at breaking down tasks and predicting how long each part would take. I started to account 
for debugging time and reviewing code, which improved the accuracy of my estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of planning and how estimation can help with time management. It also helped me become more 
aware of how long different programming tasks actually take in practice.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that other people can spot things I missed, such as better naming conventions, clearer structure, or more 
efficient logic. Code reviews helped me see my code from a different perspective.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned how to evaluate code quality, and reviewing othersâ€™ code helped reinforce good coding practices. It also 
exposed me to different styles and techniques that I might not have thought of.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more mini-projects that tie multiple skills together to help reinforce learning. I would also ensure that 
each practical builds more clearly on the last, with clear goals and outcomes.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently completed all practicals on time and committed code with helpful messages.
